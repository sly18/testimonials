             <p>CO- LEAD( Project Manager) </p>

             <p  >She Codes Africa's Chuka chapter has been instrumental in my journey as a leader. Before joining, I struggled with self-doubt and lacked confidence in public speaking. Through their support, I've grown to confidently lead projects, mentor others in tech, and share my experiences. She Codes Africa has empowered me to overcome my fears and become a role model for other girls in tech.</p>
